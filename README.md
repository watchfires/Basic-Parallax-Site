# Basic Parallax Website

This is a simple website that utilizes parallax scrolling, showing 4 different background images as the user scrolls down (or up) the page.  It was built with HTML and CSS, without the use of any frameworks.  It is also responsive in that it does not utilize parallax scrolling once the screen size is less than 568 pixels.  It was adapted from a Traversy Media YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/JttTcnidSdQ).
